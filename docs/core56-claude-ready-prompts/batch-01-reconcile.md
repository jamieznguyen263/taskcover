# Ready Claude Prompt - Already Started / Reconcile

Copy this whole file into Claude as one request. Do not send more than one batch per request.

## Operator Instruction

You are Claude. Complete only the article IDs listed in this prompt. Return a complete `articlePackages` JSON payload that passes the Taskcover validation contract below. Do not add articles outside this batch.

Batch slug: `batch-01-reconcile`
Required article IDs: `TC-001`, `TC-006`

If live browsing is available, verify current primary sources before writing any current Google, AI Search, schema, hreflang, Core Web Vitals, platform, or standards claim. If live browsing is unavailable, mark the exact claim/source limitation in `publishQaNotes.humanVerificationNeeded` instead of inventing facts.

The final response must include a fenced JSON block with a top-level `articlePackages` array. Every article package must include full Markdown body content, source URLs, internal links, forbidden-claims checklist, original asset plan, and publish QA notes.

Tai lieu nay dung de copy/paste sang Claude khi muon Claude viet noi dung cho 56 bai Core 56. Attach workbook `Taskcover_Core_56_Final_Outlines_Top10_Readiness_9_5.xlsx` cung prompt nay neu co the.

For stronger execution, send Claude one generated batch brief at a time from `docs/core56-claude-batches/` together with the Master Prompt below. Those batch files contain the article-level writer brief, required outline sections, source keys, internal links, forbidden claims, and asset requirements extracted from the workbook.

Claude must return each completed batch using `docs/core56-claude-output-contract.md` so Codex can convert the output into `InsightArticle` drafts without guessing field names or missing QA data.

## Master Prompt cho Claude

```text
You are acting as Taskcover's senior SEO Content Executive and SEO Technical Content Editor.

Project:
- Write the English-first Core 56 Insights articles for Taskcover.
- Use the attached workbook `Taskcover_Core_56_Final_Outlines_Top10_Readiness_9_5.xlsx` as the source of truth.
- The workbook contains: Core 56 Master, Final Writer Briefs, Outline Sections, QA Scorecard, Publication Roadmap, Live SERP Validation, and Sources & Governance.
- The 9.5/10 readiness score means outline quality and production readiness only. It is not a ranking guarantee.

Your job:
1. Work article-by-article or in small batches, never all 56 in one uncontrolled draft.
2. For each article, read its Final Writer Brief and Outline Sections before writing.
3. Verify current primary sources before making current SEO, Google, AI Search, schema, hreflang, Core Web Vitals, or platform-specific claims.
4. Produce a complete publish-ready English article package that Codex can convert into Taskcover Insights content.

Required output per article:
- articleId
- finalTitle
- slug
- metaTitle, max 60 characters where practical
- metaDescription, 145-160 characters where practical
- h1
- excerpt
- primaryKeyword
- secondaryKeywords
- searchIntent
- funnel
- targetMarkets
- primaryMoneyPage
- supportingPages
- recommendedSchema
- forbiddenClaimsChecklist
- sourceKeysUsed with URLs
- authorReviewerNotes
- internalLinks with suggested anchor text
- originalAssetPlan
- blocks:
  - opening answer in 80-120 words
  - H2/H3 structure exactly aligned with the workbook unless live SERP validation justifies a change
  - paragraphs, bullet lists, numbered lists, tables, checklists, and FAQ blocks where needed
  - final recommendation and CTA
- publishQaNotes:
  - evidence risks
  - cannibalization risks
  - technical SEO risks
  - claims that need human/client verification before publish

Writing standard:
- Helpful, expert-led, people-first content.
- Direct opening answer, no throat-clearing.
- Use short, self-contained passages that can be cited/extracted by AI systems.
- Use concrete decision frameworks and implementation steps.
- Explain uncertainty instead of pretending precision.
- Do not keyword-stuff.
- Do not write generic SEO advice that any competitor could publish.
- Do not cite Taskcover service pages as independent evidence; they are internal links only.
- Do not invent numbers. If a number is not source-backed, write qualitatively.
- Include USA, Canada, and Australia context only where the brief requires it, without creating doorway-style country-swapped copy.

Before finalizing each article:
- Confirm the article satisfies the workbook's mandatory FAQs, unique evidence/asset requirement, internal links, source keys, forbidden claims, update cycle, and market handling.
- List any live SERP assumptions that still need validation.
- Return the article in clean Markdown plus a structured JSON summary.
```

## Output Contract

# Core 56 Claude Output Contract

Use this contract when Claude returns completed article drafts. It keeps the handoff deterministic so Codex can convert each article into `InsightArticle`, import it as a draft, run QA, and publish EN in short backfill batches.

## Required Batch Package

Claude should return one batch at a time, matching one file in `docs/core56-claude-batches/`.

Each batch response must contain:

1. A short batch summary.
2. One complete article package per requested `TC-###` ID.
3. A final JSON array named `articlePackages`.

Do not merge multiple article IDs into one draft. Do not add extra article IDs that are not in the batch.

## Required Article Package

Each article must include these top-level fields:

```json
{
  "articleId": "TC-007",
  "title": "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO): A Practical Guide for Business Growth",
  "slug": "generative-engine-optimization-geo-a-practical-guide-for-business-growth",
  "metaTitle": "Generative Engine Optimization Guide",
  "metaDescription": "A practical GEO guide for building AI search visibility without relying on unsupported ranking guarantees.",
  "h1": "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO): A Practical Guide for Business Growth",
  "excerpt": "A concise summary for Insights listing pages.",
  "primaryKeyword": "generative engine optimization",
  "secondaryKeywords": ["GEO marketing", "GEO services", "generative search optimization"],
  "searchIntent": "Informational / commercial investigation",
  "targetMarket": "Global English",
  "targetWords": "3,800-4,800",
  "primaryMoneyPage": "/services/ai-search-optimization",
  "supportingPages": ["/services/content-marketing", "/services/digital-pr-link-building"],
  "recommendedSchema": ["Article", "BreadcrumbList"],
  "sourceKeysUsed": [{"key": "GAI", "url": "https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-features"}],
  "internalLinks": [{"url": "/services/ai-search-optimization", "anchor": "AI Search Optimization service"}],
  "forbiddenClaimsChecklist": ["No ranking guarantee", "No fabricated statistics"],
  "originalAssetPlan": "GEO operating model + maturity assessment",
  "authorReviewerNotes": "Named SEO/AI search strategist; disclose engine/date limitations.",
  "markdown": "# Full article body in Markdown",
  "faq": [{"question": "Is GEO separate from SEO?", "answer": "Short, source-safe answer."}],
  "publishQaNotes": {
    "evidenceRisks": [],
    "technicalSeoRisks": [],
    "cannibalizationRisks": [],
    "humanVerificationNeeded": []
  }
}
```

## Markdown Requirements

- Start with the H1.
- Include the 80-120 word opening answer required by the workbook.
- Follow workbook H2/H3 outline sections unless a live SERP validation note explains the change.
- Include visible FAQ questions only if `FAQPage` is recommended.
- Use tables/checklists where the workbook asks for frameworks, scorecards, or diagnostic matrices.
- Include a final recommendation and CTA aligned with the primary money page.

## Source Requirements

- Source URLs must be current and directly relevant.
- Taskcover service pages are internal links, not independent evidence sources.
- Fast-changing topics, especially Google, AI Search, schema, hreflang, Core Web Vitals, and platform features, need current primary-source verification.
- If a claim cannot be verified, write it as a recommendation or limitation, not as a fact.

## Rejection Conditions

Codex should reject or return a Claude batch for revision when:

- Any requested article ID is missing.
- Any extra article ID appears.
- A mandatory workbook FAQ, CTA, source key, internal link target, or forbidden-claim rule is ignored.
- The draft makes ranking, revenue, traffic, AI mention, or AI citation guarantees.
- The draft invents statistics, client results, reviews, author credentials, awards, or quotes.
- The JSON summary is missing or cannot be parsed.
- The article uses fake schema types or emits FAQPage without visible FAQs.
- The article gives legal, medical, or compliance advice without qualified review requirements and source limitations.

## Validation Command

After saving Claude's batch response to a local JSON or Markdown file inside the workspace, run:

```powershell
npm run core56:claude:validate -- --batch batch-02-ai-search-core --file .claude-output\claude-batch-02.md
```

The validator checks:

- requested article IDs match the batch manifest
- no missing, extra, or duplicate article packages
- required fields exist
- slug, primary keyword, and money page match the workbook manifest
- workbook source keys are present
- primary money page is included in internal links
- schema types are limited to Article, BreadcrumbList, and visible FAQPage
- obvious ranking/revenue/AI-mention guarantee language is rejected

The input file can be raw JSON or a Markdown response that contains a fenced JSON block with `articlePackages`.

## Conversion Command

Only convert after validation passes:

```powershell
npm run core56:claude:convert -- --batch batch-02-ai-search-core --file .claude-output\claude-batch-02.md --out src\content\backfill\core56-batch-02-ai-search-core.ts
```

Then run the normal backfill gate:

```powershell
npm run insights:backfill:validate
npm run insights:verify-database
```

The converter creates a typed `InsightArticle[]` module from Claude's article packages. It is still an editorial draft, not an automatic publish approval.
